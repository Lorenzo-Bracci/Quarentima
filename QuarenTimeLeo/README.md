# QuarenTime



  - Quarentime is a movie recommendation system that utilizes user-user collaborative
   filtering to process the users' responses to a questionnaire.

  -  The questionnaire requires the user to rate at least 20 random movies and compares
                  these ratings to other users ratings in our database.

  - Our initial database consists of 10,000 different movies and 610 ratings, but we are planning
                to expand it.

  -  In addition to the recommendation system, the users get to see upcoming movies, most
                  popular movies, and a chance to personalize their profiles. They can create their own watch lists, and
                    a blacklist, watched, and favorite lists that will influence the recommendation system.
